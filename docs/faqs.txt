			Alotware Operating System

Q: What is Alotware?
A: Alotware is a 32-bit hobbyist operating system.  It is written in x86 assembly for a
   PC.  It is self-hosting as well as in public domain.

Q: What does the name the "Alot" in "Alotware" stand for?
A: "A lab of time."

Q: Why does the world need another OS?
A: It is not an attempt to change the world, as there is no need of another
   operating system.  I know my limitations.
 
Q: Is it based on Linux (or any other OS)?
A: No, Alotware has been written from scratch.

Q: Why did you choose an assembly language?
A: I don't want GNU to decide the fate of my project.  [Sarcasm]

Q: How does Alotware access disks?
A: By switching to real mode.  It is not a good approach but I do not
   have a good option, either.

Q: What does "self-hosting" mean?
A: Self-hosting means that we don't need another operating system for further
   development.
   
Q: What does "public domain" mean?
A: It means that it is a free and open-source software and there are no
   restriction on doing any thing.  (As stated in license.txt.)

Q: I have a problem with Alotware.  What do I do?
A: Please report the problems and bugs to muazzam_ali@live.com.

Q: How do I contribute?
A: Alotware is a one-man project.  It is exclusively written by me as I
   have challenged myself to do so.  Still you can contribute by sending me
   the suggestions and/or code snippets.  (I will also include your name in 
   the credits section.)  You can also contribute by developing the applications.
   
Q: Where do you receive donations?
A: /dev/null or the black hole nearest to you.
