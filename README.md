## Note
I've not worked on this project for a few years.   Uploading it on GitHub for Quora.  alotware.zip contains complete source code including applications, build scripts, documentation, and disk images.  My email address is muazzam_ali at live dot com, feel free to contact--even just to say hi!

## Important:
I am the sole contributor of this project, all created from scratch.  A certain GitHub user (jhunkeler) listed helped upload the source files on GitHub (for which I'm grateful), so their name may appear in "contributors" list.
